# SAVE THE MONARCHS
---
An application to connect users that raise Monarch butterflies to each other to share posts of their success, process and problems, as well as a source to trade resources to help improve the monarch butterflies chance of survival.
## Monarch Decline Back Story
Past years have seen a dramatic drop in the amount of Monarch butterflies making their annual migration.  Only 2%-10% of monarch caterpillars survive to become a butterfly in nature and with their habitat and natural host plants in decline it has become even more important for home gardeners to provide host plants, pollinator plants and in some cases quarantining the caterpillars to protect them from disease and parasites to ensure they make it to adulthood. 
## Monarch Raisers in CA Issues
In Souther California during the end of summer nurseries tend to run out of milkweed host plants and gardeners raising monarchs find themselves with thier host plants stripped clean and a lot hungry caterpillars.  The hope with this application is to connect local users so caterpillars can be rehomed to users with plenty of milkweed, milkweed plants and/or seeds can be traded between users, success tips can be shared in the posts forum all in the hopes of helping the Monarch population.

### Users Trade Marketplace Feed
>This feed is created once a user updates their profile to include what butterfly rasing materials they need and have.  The marketplace posts what they have and a description by the user and a future ice box item is to switch the classes of these materials so that items the user needs are highlighted.

## Future Ice Box Items 
* I would like to connect to Google Maps Geolocation API so that a zip code property can be added to the user model and they can connect with local users for trading purposes.
* I would like to fix up my Needs and Haves forms so that multiple items, images and descriptions can be posted to the marketplace.
* I would like to connect a Javascript file so that I can switch the classes of the marketplace items so that the border is highlighted if the user has needs that match other users haves in the marketplace.
* I would like to implement a messaging feature so users can connect  about how to meet up to make trades.
